# Progress Renderer
A mod for Rimworld.
Automatically create scheduled renderings of the full map or only a chosen part of it.
There are many options to configure the mod in the settings.

#### Scheduled - For a later gif/video
You can choose an interval from once a quadrum to hourly.
Rendered images will be saved in a chosen directory.
For example you can use them to create an animated gif or video of your current run.

#### Area limitation
Place special corner marker designators to limit the area of what should be rendered.
You can limit this to your base and even just simply extend it later if you base grows larger than planned.

#### Automatic quality control
Quality can be controlled automatically in 1% steps for each individual world by setting a target filesize in the mod settings.
The automatic system is limited by the fact that adjustments can only be made in 1% steps, so the target is not a hard limit.
