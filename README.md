# Progress Renderer
A mod for Rimworld by Ludeon Studios
Automatically create scheduled renderings of the full map(s) or only a chosen part of it.
There are many options to configure in the mod settings
There is a how to video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vYqa65hfAA

#### Scheduled - For a later timelapses - and manually / on demand
You can choose an interval from once a quadrum to hourly.
At this interval, automatically rendered images will be saved in a chosen directory seperated into a directory for each player settlement*
Manually created rendered images can be made by pressing a key and will be saved in the manually directory

These rendered images can be used to make a timelapse (using the timelapse 2023 mod),
or be shared with other people, for instance on https://rimworld.gallery

#### Area limitation
Place special corner marker designators to limit the area to be rendered.
For instance, you can limit this area to your base and simply extend it later as you base expands.

#### Automatic quality control
Quality can be controlled automatically in 1% steps for each individual world by setting a target filesize in the mod settings.
The automatic system is limited by the fact that adjustments can only be made in 1% steps, so the target is not a hard limit.
