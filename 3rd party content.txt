fjcore: a dependency-free imaging library for C#

FJCore is part of Occipital Open Source.

FJCore brings imaging (a JPEG codec, currently) capabilities to Silverlight 2.0, or any C# implementation that may not permit access to equivalent functionality.

Key design goals include simplicity and performance.
